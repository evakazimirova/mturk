It is a passive participation, in the sense of influencing the turns and discourse. Back-channeling belongs here too (for example, “Do you agree, John?” – “Sure”, or even simply nodding in response).</li><li>Conversing – active conversation is ongoing, the person is active in turn taking.</li><li>Influencing – same as conversing, but the person is actively creating new directions in discussion. At times he or she may be interrupting others during their turns and/or be providing instructions.</li></ol>",
