## Getting Started

### How can I learn how to annotate?
All newcomers at the project are provided with a simple and short Demo Task, after which you can get down to work at once. Also, the newcomers get the chance to look through a brief emotional awareness tutorial during the work and take a small test. You can go back to the tutorials anytime: they can be found at your profile in ‘Tutorial&Tests’ section.

### Why do I need to train before I get down to work?
We know for certain that you’re an emotion recognition expert! However we suggest the short training to be sure that we all mean the same thing when we use some term.

### Will I be taken on if I fail the mini-test?
Yes. You get 2 attempts and if you still fail, the correct answers are given to you and even in this case your test is considered complete.

### I don’t want to fill in the form. May I be taken on without filling one?
Unfortunately, not. (offer point link)

### I haven’t received the access to annotation, what may the reason be?
Only those users who have successfully completed the English language test may get down to work. (see offer point)

If you have successfully completed the test but haven’t received the access to annotation, please contact us. (link)

### How can I become Jedi Master?
You can take the Jedi Master task having completed at least one Standard Task and an Extended task. May the Force be with you!

### Where can I read more about the emotions?
You can find the detailed tutorial for each scale type at your profile in ‘Tutorial&Tests’ section.

### Why do I need English for emotional recognition?
As most emotional displays depend on the context, proficiency level of English is strictly required during annotation.

### What should be the level of English for participation, then?
It’s perfect if English is your native language, but confident Upper-intermediate level is also quite enough.

### Why should I try hard to detect emotions whereas others can mark them randomly and get the same amount of money?
There is a quality control system at the Emotion Miner website, which helps exclude ‘random’ annotators from the project.


## Tasks

### What kind of tasks are there at the Emotion miner website?
A task is a set of video clips that need to be annotated. Annotation itself means watching each video fragment and marking the main emotion noticed there (chosen from several keys or pressing the ‘NO’ key if the current emotion is not on the list).

There are 3 kinds of tasks: Standard Task (15 videos), Extended task (45 videos) – increased pay, Jedi Master (50 videos) – the highest pay.

While accomplishing the Standard Task for the beginners a brief tutorial and a short test are offered.

### Are there deadlines for the annotation?
Yes, there are. Standard Task - 1 week, Extended task - 1 week, Jedi Master - 2 weeks.

### What do I need to get the money afterwards?
If you’re a beginner, you should watch the tutorial on the offered annotation scale, pass the mini-test, watch the whole video and mark the fragments according to the offered scale – after that your balance will get updated.

If you have completed at least one test for each scale group (for each completed test you get a star – this can be tracked at your profile at ‘Tests’ section), then, in order to get money for the task you just need to watch the whole video and mark all the fragments.

### I’m ruining the deadline, what should I do?
You may refuse finishing the task by pressing the ‘give up’ key

and in this case, you get 50% of the payment for fully annotated videos.

### I haven’t got the access to longer tasks, how can I get it?
To get a longer task, you should accomplish at least one shorter task, also you have to pass at least one mini-test for each scale group. Completed short tests are shown in the form of small stars at your profile in ‘Tutorial&Tests’ section.

### I have annotated all the videos in the task, but my balance hasn’t been updated. What’s the matter?
Please, take the mini-test for the tutorial applied to this particular task.

If you have passed the test (or there wasn’t any) and annotated all the videos in the task, but your balance hasn’t been updated, please, contact us (feedback form link).

If you want to get money for the task partly done, you need to refuse the task by pressing the ‘give up’ key.
![‘give up’ key](./assets/screenshot.png)
In this case you get 50% of the payment for fully annotated videos.

If the video isn’t annotated to the end, you don’t get the payment for it.

### I’ve missed the deadline and haven’t received the money for the task partly done. How can I get this money?
Unfortunately, the tasks partly done with the deadline missed don’t get paid for (offer link, see point №). Next time make sure you have used the ‘give up’ option before the deadline in order to get money for the tasks partly done.
