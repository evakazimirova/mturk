# Emotion Miner General Rules

__All users are kindly requested to study the Emotion Miner rules before starting to work with the platform__

__Emotion Miner__ is a global online video-annotation platform, where you can earn money for marking different emotional states in the given video.

To participate in the initiative are invited all interested people (over 18) with excellent English language skills (all videos are in English, also most emotional displays depend on the context, so the proficiency level of English is strictly required for annotation).

To start working you should follow five simple steps:

1. Sign up at the website (link);
2. Confirm your e-mail (confirmation link will be sent immediately to your e-mail);
3. Fill in the form;
4. Answer several short questions so we can make sure your English really matches the demanded level;
5. Accomplish the Demo Task to become familiar with the platform’ functions - and make your first money quickly.


## Tasks

A task on the Emotion Miner website is a set of video clips that need to be annotated. The annotation procedure consists of two steps: first you should watch the whole video, then watch again several video fragments previously extracted. Annotation itself means watching each video fragment and marking the main emotion noticed there (chosen from several keys or pressing the ‘NO’ key if the current emotion is not on the list). You are always able to repeat the video if you need it.

There are 3 kinds of tasks: Standard Task (15 videos), Extended task (45 videos) – increased pay, Jedi Master (50 videos) – the highest pay. To get the access to an Extended task, do at least one Standard Task; for access to Jedi Master Task, do at least one Extended task.

There are deadlines for completing the assigned tasks: Standard Task - 1 week, Extended task - 1 week, Jedi Master - 2 weeks.

If you want to get money for the task partly done, you need to refuse the task by pressing the ‘give up’ button. In this case you get 50% of the payment for fully annotated videos. If the video isn’t annotated to the end, you don’t get the payment for it. Unfortunately, the tasks partly done with the deadline missed don’t get paid for (offer link, see point №). Next time make sure you have used the ‘give up’ option before the deadline in order to get money for the tasks partly done.


## Emotions. Training. Tests

All the emotions that need to be annotated are divided into six groups (if you want to know more details, please visit ‘Tutorial&Tests’ section of your profile):

- Basic Emotions part 1
- Basic Emotions: part 2
- Social Emotions
- Person and Situation
- Social Relation
- Conversation

Standard Task contains an annotation task for selected video fragments with reference to one group of emotions. Extended Task and Jedi Master Task may include annotation tasks with reference to different emotional scales (but any video of the assigned task corresponds only to one group of emotions).

If you’re a beginner, you should watch the tutorial on the offered annotation scale, pass the mini-test, watch the whole video and mark the fragments according to the offered scale – after that your balance will get updated.
To pass a short test you get 2 attempts and if you still fail, the correct answers are given to you and even in this case your test is considered complete (noted with a star at your profile in “Tutorial&Tests” section). You have full access to all tutorials available any time you want (see “Tutorials&Tests” section).

To get a longer task (Extended or Jedi Master), you should accomplish at least one shorter task, also you have to pass at least one mini-test for each scale group. Moreover, you can pass other tests and improve your annotation ranking (see “Annotators’ rating” section).


## Payments

Unfortunately, money transfer around the world isn’t possible. Currently, only the residents of the USA, Canada, the EU, the UK, the Russian Federation and Belarus can take part in the project. Please consider that money can only be transferred to the following cards: MasterCard, VISA.

When your money transfer query is accepted, there will be a checking results procedure within one week. __Please notice that we reserve the right to block your money withdrawal if your work fails a quality control test.__

Money can be withdrawn from your balance only when it’s equal or more than $10.

You can invite your friends to take part in the project by leaving their contacts here (link). In such case you will get 10% from what your friends earn (stating that friends are supposed to sign up in the course of 2 days).
